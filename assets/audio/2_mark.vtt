1
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.320
We recognise that consumers demand ethically produced products.

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.420
I think the best way to describe what we think is sustainable farming

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.399
is protecting our people, protecting nature and working alongside

4
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.850
nature and also protecting our profits for the long term.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.059
We are obviously not mining our resources.

6
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.159
We're not burning nature's capital. We're really trying to work alongside nature and

7
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.530
leverage our opportunities within our farming business on what nature

8
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.279
naturally provides as a sustainable farmer as well.

9
00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.680
We really need to be seen as an industry, as being trustworthy.

10
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.227
We need to be transparent. And that really gives us currency in

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.219
our farming operations.
