00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.669
From a sustainability perspective,

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.409
climate change is

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:05.999
the main thing on the block as far

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
as I'm concerned.

5
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.639
I want to do something impactful in

6
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.279
terms of climate change.

7
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.359
I want to be as useful as I possibly

8
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.536
can in terms of reducing

9
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.409
greenhouse gas emissions at

10
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.179
a global level and obviously, we're

11
00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.589
trying to be as efficient as we

12
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.870
possibly can with our irrigation use

13
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.520
so that we're pumping electricity

14
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.730
consumption is as low as we can.

15
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.306
Asparagopsis seaweed has

16
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.059
been identified over

17
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.979
the last few years and research

18
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.689
work done by CSIRO

19
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.999
to prove the fact that

20
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.639
it will reduce methane emissions

21
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.012
in ruminants by up to 80 per

22
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.369
cent.

23
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.809
It's going to have a significant

24
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.309
impact on the amount of methane

25
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.310
emitted from sheep

26
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.278
and cattle. In a dairy

27
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.069
scenario we should see a 10 per

28
00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:52.259
cent improvement in productivity

29
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.359
by that reduction in methane

30
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
emissions.

31
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.510
I am concerned

32
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.369
that the next generation of my kids

33
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.719
are all in their early 20s

34
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.729
and they, like a lot of their

35
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.102
contemporaries, I think, are

36
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.179
concerned about what the future

37
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.748
might look like on the back of a

38
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.379
climate change scenario.
