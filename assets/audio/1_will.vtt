I believe sustainable everything is important because if it's not sustainable,

2
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.479
you're not going to last very long in whatever you do.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.339
So what we're trying to do here is, like a lot of dairy farmers across the

4
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.574
nation, is to just make sure what we do, we can do a year in, year

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.339
out and be sustainable in the future and have a farm to hand

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.449
on to the next generation. They've done a heck of a lot to

7
00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.399
improve the sustainability and just the general farm ecosystem

8
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.259
across the whole farm by planting out gullies and waterways,

9
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.249
planting a lot of windbreak lines between paddocks.

10
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.579
I'm pretty sure they planted around twenty thousand native trees.

11
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.549
It's taken our farm from a treeless farm to, we've got

12
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.649
trees everywhere, which is just wonderful.
